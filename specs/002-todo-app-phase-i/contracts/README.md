# Contracts for Todo App Phase I

This directory is for API contracts. Since the Todo App Phase I is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application and operates with in-memory storage, there are no external API contracts (e.g., OpenAPI, GraphQL) to define in this phase.

All interactions are direct user input via the console, processed by the application's internal logic.
